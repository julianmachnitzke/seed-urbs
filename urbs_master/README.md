# SEED Himalaya Project - URBS Website
# /urbs_master

This folder essentially contains the URBS algorithm. Note that the input.py file in /urbs_master/urbs has beend adapted so that it now reads input data in from of .json files from the /urbs_master/urbs/Input folder.

Note that the single-year-example.xlsx in /urbs_master/Input is a dummy file and must not be deleted although it does not contain information used by the algorithm.

/urbs_master/result contains results from the previous URBS run that will then be uploaded to the website.
