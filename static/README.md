# SEED Himalaya Project - URBS Website
# /static

This folder contains several .css files setting the style of the website.

Additionally, the folder /static/hydrorivers contains a shapefile of the [HydroRivers](https://www.hydrosheds.org/products/hydrorivers) dataset. The shapefile contains data for rivers in the Northern India / Himalayas region. As the scope of the project is related to micro grids only rivers with an average annual discharge between 1 and 100 mÂ³/s are considered.

The folder /static/images contains pictures that are printed on the website as well as the graphs that are created during the process and that are then uploaded to the website.

Lastly, the folder /static/functions contains some python functions in the utils.py file that are called during the operation of the website.
